## Summary of results

## Methodology
### Overview

The samples are fabricated by mixing ecoflex with particles of different sizes at different mass and volume ratios. Below are the particle sizes used in increasing size:

* -20 Mesh Iron (100 microns)
* -70 Mesh Iron (210 microns)
* Iron 12 (300 microns)
* 6-10 microns
* 1-4 microns

Types of ecoflex used:
* Ecoflex 30
* Ecoflex 20
* Ecoflex 10

This report includes a summary for just _*Ecoflex 30*_.

### Fabrication procedure

The experiments were designed by volume ratio where the ecoflex and particles were mixed by measuring their volumes until ratios (specified below) were achieved.
For the first samples(samples #1 to #6) the samples were mixed in the volume ratios shown in Table 1. The mixtures yielded the mass ratios shown on the table.

```{r echo=FALSE}
tibble(sample_number = avg_and_std$sample_number[1:6], particles_size = avg_and_std$particle_size_microns[1:6], ecolfex = avg_and_std$ecoflex[1:6], volume_ratio = avg_and_std$volume_ratio[1:6], mass_ratio = avg_and_std$mass_ratio[1:6], ) %>% gt() %>% tab_header(
    title = "Table 1: Experiment design for first 6 samples"
  ) 

```

The rest of the the samples were mixed in the following volume ratios:

```{r}
tibble(Volume_ratios = avg_and_std$volume_ratio[7:12],
       Ecoflex_part_A_volume =avg_and_std$a_volume_cm3[7:12],
       Ecoflex_part_B_volume = avg_and_std$b_volume_cm3[7:12],
       Particles_volume = avg_and_std$particles_volume_cm3[7:12]) %>% gt() %>% tab_header(
    title = "Table 2: Volume ratios used in the rest of the samples",
    subtitle = "All volumes are in cubic centimeters"
  ) 
```

The mixing procedure starts with placing a 50 gram-sized cup on mass measuring scale and zeroing the scale. The volume of part A ecoflex is then measuring using a volumetric syringe and then poured into the 50 gram-sized cup. The volume of particles is then measuring also using a similar syringe and poured into the same cup. Finally, the volume of part B ecoflex is then measuring and poured into the cup. Mass measuremements are read off the measuring scale and recorded after each addition of components into the cup. The table therefore consists of both volume measurements and mass measurements.

The mixture is then mixed by hand using a popsickle stick for about 10 seconds. The cup is then inserted into a "THINKY" centrifugal mixer and mixed at 2000 revolutions per minute(rpm) for 30 seconds. After completion, the mixture is poured into 3D printed moulds shown in figure 1 below and inserted into a oven at 60 degrees celcius. The mold is designed to allow for 5 samples for each mixing ratio. The The curing times for all the samples are shown in Table 3.

After the samples have had sufficient time to cure, they are taken out of the oven photographed and their inductances measured.

### Inductance and permeability measurements

The 3D printed molds are designed in such a way that the resulting sample is able to fit into a cylindrical coil of N turns and l length. This allows for the measurement of the inductance of the core using an RLC meter. Table 3 shows the avereage, median, and standard deviation of the inductances of the 5 samples for each mixing ratio. Table 

The relative permeability is calculated from the inducance using the inductance formula of a coil with a core. See equation 1 below.
